# Machine Learning Flappy Bird
Hobby project to help me learn how to use machine learning libraries. The project is structured so that *flappy_build_data.py* is used to play the game and generate training data (data only gets added upon successful points). Then a .csv of the training data can be outputted, and used to train a classifier model. This model is then used in *flappy.py* to play autonomously. 

# Requirements: 
NumPy, 
PyGame, 
Keras 

# How to run: 
*flappy_build_data.py* automatically starts in training mode. To switch training mode on/off, press t (train). To print how many samples have been collected to far, press (print). To output the data to *flappy_data.csv*, press w (write). 

#Enjoy!
